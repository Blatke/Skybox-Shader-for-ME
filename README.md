# Skybox-Shader-for-ME
HS2/AIS Studio Shader

This is for letting Material Editor show the proper options for users to adjust the tint color, exposure and rotation of a skybox item in Studio. 

# How to Use
Download .zipmod file for the latest version on the [Release](https://github.com/Blatke/Skybox-Shader-for-ME/releases) page, and put it into your **mods** folder.

When you add a skybox item in Studio, you can select this skybox on Workspace and open **MaterialEditor** tab. You can now find that the skybox's material can have some functional options on the tab, such as tint color, exposure and rotation.

Commonly, this mod is compatible with the skybox items using the shaders of Skybox/Cubemap or Skybox/Panoramic in Studio. If the skybox uses other shaders, this mod might not help.
